speak_rect('Colleague: Maybe just a basic question. But what i see from the last lectures is: that you can not trust an AI that it will give you the correct output or result? Maybe there is a high chance (95% or higher) but never a 100% chance. At least when it comes to machine learning and label data correct. Are there methods to detect such wrong output or at the end a human is needed to verify the output?');

speak_bubble('Myself helping: This is a basic problem. AI can only calculate in 0 and 1s on transistor level. If you describe the solution in percentages ("numbers" being able to processes by normal processing units) you can calculate a result with a computer, maybe see.')
